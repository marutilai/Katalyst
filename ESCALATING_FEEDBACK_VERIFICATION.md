# Escalating Feedback Verification

## Summary
We have successfully implemented and verified that custom error messages with escalating feedback are properly propagated from `tool_runner.py` to `agent_react.py`.

## Key Components

### 1. Tool Runner (`tool_runner.py`)
- Creates escalating feedback messages when operations are blocked
- Uses `_handle_consecutive_block_escalation()` to generate appropriate feedback levels:
  - üí° HINT: 1-2 consecutive blocks
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: 3-4 consecutive blocks  
  - üö® CRITICAL: 5+ consecutive blocks
- Sets `state.error_message` with the full error including escalation

### 2. Agent React (`agent_react.py:293-309`)
- Receives error messages from state
- Detects escalation markers in error messages
- Preserves custom messages by passing them to `format_error_for_llm()`
- Ensures escalating feedback reaches the LLM intact

### 3. Error Handling (`error_handling.py:88`)
- `format_error_for_llm()` accepts optional `custom_message` parameter
- When provided, custom message takes priority over default formatting
- Clean solution without brittle substring checking

## Verification Results

### Unit Tests
‚úÖ Custom TOOL_REPETITION messages preserved
‚úÖ Custom TOOL_ERROR messages preserved  
‚úÖ Default messages used when no escalation markers present

### Integration Tests
‚úÖ Escalating feedback flows from tool_runner to agent_react
‚úÖ Consecutive block counting works correctly
‚úÖ Different escalation levels trigger appropriate messages

### End-to-End Testing
‚úÖ Repetitive tool calls receive escalating feedback
‚úÖ Redundant operations receive escalating feedback
‚úÖ Agent receives the exact custom messages without generic text appended

## Example Flow

1. Agent tries `list_files` 5 times in a row
2. Tool runner blocks the operation and adds:
   ```
   üö® CRITICAL: You've been blocked 5 times in a row! 
   You are COMPLETELY STUCK and need to FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE YOUR APPROACH.
   ```
3. Agent react receives this error and preserves it exactly
4. LLM sees the urgent feedback and (hopefully) changes strategy

This implementation ensures the agent receives increasingly urgent feedback to help break out of repetitive patterns.
