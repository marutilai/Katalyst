# TODO

- Add interactive configuration using typer (or similar library) to let users adjust all input variables and API keys easily.
- Add Tree-sitter support for C and C++ (grammar integration and code definition extraction)
- Generalize the check_syntax utility (in src/katalyst_agent/tools/write_to_file.py) to support syntax checking for more languages (not just Python).
- Write more tests for all tools and measure/improve test coverage.
- [DONE] Explore LangGraph React/Code agents for planning
- Ollama for local models 
- Langfuse for observability
