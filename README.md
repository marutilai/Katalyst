# Katalyst Agent

A modular, node-based terminal coding agent for Python, designed for robust, extensible, and production-ready workflows.

## TODO

- Generalize the `check_syntax` utility (in `src/katalyst_agent/tools/write_to_file.py`) to support syntax checking for more languages (not just Python).

<!-- More TODOs will be added here as the project evolves. -->
