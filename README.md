# Project Status: Awaiting User Requirements

This project is currently in a holding state until specific user requirements are provided.

## How to Proceed
1. Review the `REQUIREMENTS.md` file for the current project status.
2. Once requirements are provided, implementation tasks will be planned and executed.

## Placeholder Code
A placeholder Python module (`src/awaiting_user_requirements.py`) is included to indicate the current status. Running this module will print a message stating that the project is awaiting user requirements.
